# Kinect22SMPLX
A data driven model targeted  to transfer mocap data from Kinect2 to SMPL-X theta and beta parameters.
Due to the fact that the display effect in the Unity engine still cannot meet expectations, there are considerable unrealistic deformations and overlaps, 
thus further development is needed.
